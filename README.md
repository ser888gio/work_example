This repository showcases examples of Combobox components developed using the **Headless UI Library**. The project leverages modern front-end technologies to build accessible, customizable, and reusable UI components.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: For robust and type-safe JavaScript development.
- **Next.js**: As the React framework for building the project.
- **React**: For building component-based user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To style the application with utility-first CSS.
- **Headless UI**: For accessible, unstyled UI components.
- **Storybook**: For documenting and testing the Combobox components in isolation.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
/components
    Combobox/    # Combobox component implementations
